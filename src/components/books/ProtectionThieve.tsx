                        A wealthy merchant who was a devoted follower of Lord Narasimha Saraswati had a habit of offering a portion of his earnings to the poor and the temple. He attributed his success and prosperity to the blessings of the Guru.

                        One day, the merchant embarked on a long journey to conduct trade in distant lands. He carried with him a large sum of gold and valuable goods. Before leaving, he visited Lord Narasimha Saraswati at Ganagapur, seeking his blessings for a safe and successful journey.

                        As the merchant traveled through a dense forest, a gang of thieves spotted him and decided to rob him. Unaware of the danger, the merchant continued on his way, chanting the name of Lord Narasimha Saraswati.
