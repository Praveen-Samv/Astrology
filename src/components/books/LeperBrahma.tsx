                    <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                        A devout Brahmin, who had been suffering from leprosy for years, lived in despair in a small village. His condition caused him immense physical pain and social ostracism, leaving him isolated and hopeless. Despite his suffering, the Brahmin remained a staunch devotee of Lord Narasimha Saraswati and often prayed for his grace.
                    </p>
                    <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed mt-4">
                        One day, he heard from travelers about the miraculous powers of the Guru and decided to seek his blessings. With great effort, he traveled to Ganagapur, the holy site where Lord Narasimha Saraswati resided, carrying nothing but his unwavering faith.

                    <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                        Upon reaching Ganagapur, the Brahmin approached the Lord with folded hands and tear-filled eyes. He said:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote className="italic text-gray-700 border-l-4 border-gray-400 pl-4 my-4">
                        "O Lord, I have suffered this affliction for so long. My body may be diseased, but my heart is devoted to you. Please have mercy on me and restore my life."
                    </blockquote>
                    <p className="text-gray-600 leading-relaxed">
                        Lord Narasimha Saraswati, moved by his humility and devotion, instructed the Brahmin to perform Saptaha Parayana—a seven-day reading of the Guru Charitra. He said:
                    </p>
                    <blockquote className="italic text-gray-700 border-l-4 border-gray-400 pl-4 my-4">

                        The Brahmin immersed himself in the reading of the Guru Charitra for seven consecutive days. With each passing day, his mind grew more peaceful, and his heart filled with hope and devotion. On the seventh day, as he completed the final chapter, a miraculous transformation occurred—his diseased skin began to heal, and by the time he finished his prayers, he was completely cured.

                        Overwhelmed with gratitude, the Brahmin returned to Lord Narasimha Saraswati and bowed at his feet. The Lord blessed him and said:
